    "Responding to reports that smoking could be banned in some outdoor spaces in England, the prime minister said \"we have got to take action\" to reduce the burden on the NHS.\n",
    "\n",
    "The details remain unclear but smoking could be banned in pub gardens, outdoor restaurants, and outside hospitals and sports grounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Health experts have welcomed the plans, but the BBC has been told that some ministers have raised concerns about the impact the ban could have on the hospitality sector.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some business owners have already raised concerns. Pub landlady Lisa Burrage, 55, said pubs should be able to choose whether or not to go smoke-free and \"it is not up to the government to make that decision\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\"This will be just another hurdle we have to face in hospitality and one we can do without,\" Ms Burrage told the BBC.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tony Harding, 57, a publican in Salisbury, said residents who live near his pub would probably not be happy if his punters began smoking and \"blocking the pathway in the street, instead of [using] my nice comfortable garden\".\n",
    "\n",
    "But the PM stressed the health impact in his message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tobacco use is the UK's single biggest preventable cause of death, killing two-thirds of long-term users and causing 80,000 deaths every year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Health authorities also say there is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any new ban would apply only to England. It is not yet clear if it would apply to the rest of the UK though devolved governments could choose to bring in similar rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "When questioned on the proposals, Sir Keir said the government was \"going to take decisions in this space\" and more details would be revealed.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I think it’s important to get the balance right,\" he said, adding that the NHS was \"on its knees\".\n",

    "\n",
    "But she added it was important to ensure that there were still outdoor areas for people to \"smoke in the open air, rather than inside their homes\".\n",
    "\n",
    "However, those from the hospitality sector are worried the ban will hurt businesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"This needs to be thought through very carefully before we damage businesses and economic growth and jobs,\" Kate Nicholls, chief executive of trade group UK Hospitality, told the Today programme.\n",

    "The British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA), a leading industry body which represents 20,000 pubs in the UK, said pub numbers had significantly decreased because of factors including the Covid pandemic and energy crisis.\n",

    "            Unite calls for 1% wealth tax on super-rich to fund UK public sector pay rises The demand from Britains second biggest union will test truce with Labour at next month s TUC conferenceToby Helm Political EditorSat 24 Aug 2024 19.05 BST Share\n",
    "              Britain s second biggest trade union is calling on the new Labour government to introduce an emergency 1% wealth tax on the assets of the super-rich to pay for 10% pay rises for public sector workers and fill more than 100,000 NHS vacancies. \n",
    "             The demand from Unite is in one of several motions to the Trades Union Congress, which meets in Brighton next month, that will expose tensions between \n",
    "             Keir Starmer s government and sections of the union movement. It comes as Rachel Reeves is preparing for her first budget as chancellor,\n",
    "              on 30 October. Labour MPs and ministers believe that the TUC conference could mark the moment when an effective truce between many unions and Labour \n",
    "             –helping Starmer s general election campaign – may begin to break down as the prime minister and Reeves double down on their commitment to fiscal\n",
    "              responsibility and stress the need for hard choices if the economy is to be restored to health. Other key trade unions are preparing to press for further \n",
    "             policy changes from Labour, including abandoning the two-child benefit cap, which Starmer has so far resisted, and the reversal of the recent decision to \n",
    "             end winter fuel payments for millions of pensioners, which has been causing a serious backlash among Labour backbenchers. While Reeves is understood to be considering increases in capital gains and inheritance taxes in the budget, Unites motion to the TUC conference goes much further, saying that, \n",
    "             with local authorities in financial peril, an urgently needed boost to public investment cannot wait for economic growth to materialise at an unspecified point in the future. \n",
    "             Unites plan is for a tax of 1% to be applied on the assets of those worth more than £4m, which it says would raise £25bn a year to fund investment in public services and avoid a return to austerity. Under the plan, someone with assets worth £6m would face a 1% tax on the £2m above the £4m threshold. \n",
    "             These assets would include property, shares and bank accounts but would not include mortgaged property.\n",
    "              Unite points to research showing that the richest 50 families in the UK now have assets worth nearly £500bn.Sharon Graham, the general secretary of Unite, said: Unite s resolution to the TUC on the economy calls things by their real name. \n",
    "             The British economy is broken. Britain led the world s first industrial revolution. But due to decades of underinvestment in manufacturing and national infrastructure, we are now falling disastrously behind other countries in the new technological age and the transition to net zero. \n",
    "             We need serious investment in our crippled public services and in industry to ensure a prosperous future for Britain s workers and their communities. We won t get the money needed for that just by waiting for growth. \n",
    "             Unite was a big donor to the Labour party in 2019 but did not contribute to this year s election efforts, saying the election manifesto did not go far enough on protecting workers  rights and jobs in the oil and gas industry.The RMT transport union has also tabled a motion to the conference calling for a wealth tax to fund public investment, \n",
    "             and the abandonment of what it describes as unnecessarily restrictive and arbitrary fiscal rules which limit the government s ability to borrow. \n",
    "             A motion from the shop workers  union, Usdaw, calls for an end to the two-child benefit cap, and an amendment to the same motion from the PCS civil service union calls on the TUC to oppose cuts to the winter fuel allowance and demands appropriate taxation of corporations and the super-rich to fund the social security improvements identified in this motion.\n",
    "              The TUC is also expected to press for pay restoration to make up for a decade of real-terms salary cuts for public sector workers. \n",
    "             Such demands will further add to the strains between Labour and its union backers after a series of pay deals between the Starmer-led government and striking workers in sectors ranging from healthcare to the railways.\"\"\"\n",
