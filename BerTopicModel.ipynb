While Reeves is understood to be considering increases in capital gains and inheritance taxes in the budget, Unites motion to the TUC conference goes much further, saying that, \n",
    "             with local authorities in financial peril, an urgently needed boost to public investment cannot wait for economic growth to materialise at an unspecified point in the future. \n",
    "             Unites plan is for a tax of 1% to be applied on the assets of those worth more than £4m, which it says would raise £25bn a year to fund investment in public services and avoid a return to austerity. Under the plan, someone with assets worth £6m would face a 1% tax on the £2m above the £4m threshold. \n",
    "             These assets would include property, shares and bank accounts but would not include mortgaged property.\n",
    "              Unite points to research showing that the richest 50 families in the UK now have assets worth nearly £500bn.Sharon Graham, the general secretary of Unite, said: Unite s resolution to the TUC on the economy calls things by their real name. \n",
    "             The British economy is broken. Britain led the world s first industrial revolution. But due to decades of underinvestment in manufacturing and national infrastructure, we are now falling disastrously behind other countries in the new technological age and the transition to net zero. \n",

    "             and the abandonment of what it describes as unnecessarily restrictive and arbitrary fiscal rules which limit the government s ability to borrow. \n",
